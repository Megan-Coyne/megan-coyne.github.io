                        I've been known to be someone that seems like I "can't make up my mind," but to me, it's more that I am so excited about the subjects that I study that I would love to just know everything... you know? But alas, that isn't possible. So, until they invent intelligence by osmosis, here are some of the niche topics within computer science and math that I am highly interested in pursuing in a career or even developing a potential Ph.D. thesis around!
